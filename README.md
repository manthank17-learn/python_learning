# Python Core Learning Notebook 🐍

*python_learning*

⚠️ *THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTION-GRADE PROJECT*

This repository documents my *structured learning journey in Python*, starting from core fundamentals and progressing through problem-solving, exercises, and small experiments.

It is a learning notebook that shows *how I think, how I learn, and how I build foundations*.

## Why this repository exists

- To build strong Python fundamentals  
- To practice problem decomposition and logical thinking  
- To maintain a consistent learning log  
- To sync my learning across multiple machines using Git  
- To demonstrate my *learning process*, not just final answers  

Each folder represents a *learning phase*, not a finished product.
